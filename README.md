# Bug Bounty Reference

A list of bug bounty write-up that is categorized by the bug nature, this is inspired by https://github.com/djadmin/awesome-bug-bounty

# Introduction

I have been reading for Bug Bounty write-ups for a few months, I found it extremely useful to read relevant write-up when I found a certain type of vulnerability that I have no idea how to exploit. Let say you found a RPO (Relativce Path Overwrite) in a website, but you have no idea how should you exploit that, then the perfect place to go would be [here](http://blog.innerht.ml/rpo-gadgets/). Or you have found your customer is using oauth mechanism but you have no idea how should we test it, the other perfect place to go would be [here](https://whitton.io/articles/obtaining-tokens-outlook-office-azure-account/)

My intention is to make a full and complete list of common vulnerability that are publicly disclosed bug bounty write-up, and let Bug Bounty Hunter to use this page as a reference when they want to gain some insight for a particular kind of vulnerability during Bug Hunting, feel free to submit pull request. Okay, enough for chit-chatting, let's get started.
